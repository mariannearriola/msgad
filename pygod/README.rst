PyGOD is a **Python library** for **graph outlier detection** (anomaly detection).
This exciting yet challenging field has many key applications, e.g., detecting
suspicious activities in social networks [#Dou2020Enhancing]_  and security systems [#Cai2021Structural]_.

PyGOD includes **10+** graph outlier detection algorithms.
For consistency and accessibility, PyGOD is developed on top of `PyTorch Geometric (PyG) <https://www.pyg.org/>`_
and `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_, and follows the API design of `PyOD <https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod>`_.
See examples below for detecting outliers with PyGOD in 5 lines!


**PyGOD is featured for**:

* **Unified APIs, detailed documentation, and interactive examples** across various graph-based algorithms.
* **Comprehensive coverage** of 10+ graph outlier detectors.
* **Full support of detections at multiple levels**, such as node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks.
* **Scalable design for processing large graphs** via mini-batch and sampling.
* **Streamline data processing with PyG**--fully compatible with PyG data objects.

**Outlier Detection Using PyGOD with 5 Lines of Code**\ :

.. code-block:: python


    # train a dominant detector
    from pygod.detector import DOMINANT

    model = DOMINANT(num_layers=4, epoch=20)  # hyperparameters can be set here
    model.fit(train_data)  # input data is a PyG data object

    # get outlier scores on the training data (transductive setting)
    score = model.decision_score_

    # predict labels and scores on the testing data (inductive setting)
    pred, score = model.predict(test_data, return_score=True)

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Note on PyG and PyTorch Installation**\ :
PyGOD depends on `torch <https://https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_ and `torch_geometric (including its optional dependencies) <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html#>`_.
To streamline the installation, PyGOD does **NOT** install these libraries for you.
Please install them from the above links for running PyGOD:

* torch>=2.0.0
* torch_geometric>=2.3.0

It is recommended to use **pip** for installation.
Please make sure **the latest version** is installed, as PyGOD is updated frequently:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pygod            # normal install
   pip install --upgrade pygod  # or update if needed

Alternatively, you could clone and run setup.py file:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/pygod-team/pygod.git
   cd pygod
   pip install .

**Required Dependencies**\ :

* python>=3.8
* numpy>=1.24.3
* scikit-learn>=1.2.2
* scipy>=1.10.1
* networkx>=3.1

API Cheatsheet & Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Full API Reference: (https://docs.pygod.org). API cheatsheet for all detectors:

* **fit(data)**\ : Fit the detector with train data.
* **predict(data)**\ : Predict on test data (train data if not provided) using the fitted detector.

Key Attributes of a fitted detector:

* **decision_score_**\ : The outlier scores of the input data. Outliers tend to have higher scores.
* **label_**\ : The binary labels of the input data. 0 stands for inliers and 1 for outliers.
* **threshold_**\ : The determined threshold for binary classification. Scores above the threshold are outliers.

**Input of PyGOD**: Please pass in a `PyG Data object <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.data.Data.html#torch_geometric.data.Data>`_.
See `PyG data processing examples <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/introduction.html#data-handling-of-graphs>`_.
